# Snake-Game
A Snake game in Java typically involves creating a simple graphical interface where a player controls a snake using keyboard inputs. The objective is to navigate the snake to eat food items that appear randomly on the screen, which causes the snake to grow longer. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or with the boundaries of the game area.
